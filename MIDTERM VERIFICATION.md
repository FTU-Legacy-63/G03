**NHA408E Midterm Exam • Week 5 Readiness Verification**

**MIDTERM EXAM**

**Project Readiness & Contribution Verification**

Group: 3 				Product: Who runs the world? 		Instructor: Assoc. Prof. Dr. Phan Tran Trung Dung

Team representative: Vũ Lưu Minh Ngọc 	Repository: [https://github.com/FTU-Legacy-63/G03](https://github.com/FTU-Legacy-63/G03)	Date: 16/09/2026

**Purpose.** This exam is a short verification of the project evidence already available in your repository. Do not rewrite Week 1 \- Week 5 submissions. Focus only on what still needs to be clarified before moving into Week 6\.

**Submission:** Submit one file to your team repository: **MIDTERM\_VERIFICATION.md**

**A. GROUP VERIFICATION**

**1\. What is the biggest issue your team still needs to solve before Week 6?**

*Choose one issue only. It may be about financial logic, data, assumptions, scoring, MVP scope, user flow, interface, or technical feasibility.*

Answer: The biggest issue is finalizing the scenario design, clearly connecting and arranging scenarios reasonably to align with  macroeconomic conditions, Liquidity Demand and the player's OMO decisions. 

**2\. Why is this issue important?**

*Explain what part of your core product depends on it and what may go wrong if the issue is not solved.*

Answer: Scenario design is the starting point of the core game flow, as it translates macroeconomic conditions and liquidity conditions that the player uses to make an OMO decision. If the scenarios are not arranged consistently with changes in macroeconomic conditions and Liquidity Demand, the player may receive unclear or conflicting signals and cannot meaningfully decide the direction, volume, and instrument of intervention. As a result, the changes in Liquidity Gap and Interbank Rate may not meaningfully reflect the scenario or the player’s decision.

**3\. What has your team done about this issue so far?**

*Briefly describe what you have already done to understand or solve it \- for example: checked a source, tested a calculation, compared options, built a sample case, tried a prototype, changed the design, or simplified the scope.*

Answer: The team has defined the core scenario-to-output flow as Scenario/Liquidity Demand → OMO Decision → Commercial Bank Bids → Auction Allocation → Realized Supply/Withdrawal → Liquidity Gap → Interbank Rate. We have also developed and tested sample cases for liquidity shortage, balance, and excess liquidity, and designed rules to carry the remaining liquidity condition into the next decision round.

**4\. What will your team do next about this issue?**

*State the next concrete action before or during Week 6 \- for example: test more cases, replace a data source, change a rule, simplify the MVP, remove a feature, build a small prototype, or validate a calculation.*

Answer: The team will finalize the sequence of scenarios by defining how changes in macroeconomic conditions and Liquidity Demand effects across decision rounds. We will then connect each scenario to the existing Auction and Economic Engines and test whether the market signals are financially consistent with the OMO decisions available to the player and the resulting changes in Liquidity Gap and Interbank Rate. We will also test scenarios in which new market information changes the expected duration of liquidity conditions, so that players can reassess their OMO instruments in later decision rounds.

**B. MEMBER CONTRIBUTION VERIFICATION**

Complete one row for each member. Do not list only roles such as “Developer”, “Researcher”, or “Designer”.

| Member | What did this member actually produce? | How is it used in the project? | What can this member personally explain, calculate, demonstrate, or reproduce? |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Vũ Lưu Minh Ngọc | Group coordination, data/formula verification, formula revision and regression | Production of reasonable output result (Week 4 \- Regression & Logic Test, Input-Output mapping) | The financial base and the economic base of the project |
| Nguyễn Bảo Hiền | Source research, data collection, data cleaning and explanation development | Providing data and foundation for model development (Week 3 \- Source & Database) | Source of data, explanation to users and user performance judgement |
| Nguyễn Minh Trang | Source research, data collection, data cleaning and working interface demo | Providing processed data and interactive interface demo Week 3 \- Source & Database, Week 5\_Working interface draft) | Data collection and UI/UX workflow  |
| Nguyễn Khánh Linh | Formula research, model structuring, regression and economic-model development | Providing formula for calculation and Logic Test (Week 4 \- Formula, Rules, Regression & Logic Test) | Explanation of economic engine in Logic test file |

**Verification note.** Because one person may upload files on behalf of the team, Git commit authorship is not used as proof of individual contribution. The table records each member’s stated output, its use in the project, and what the member should be able to explain or reproduce if clarification is required.
